<h1>Code Journal</h1>
<p></p><b>Please note: Everything here is currently under construction, just doing some testing within github</b></p>
<p>
  This site is a personal space for documenting and visualising concepts I enjoy working with, particularly in the areas of algorithms, data structures, and spatial reasoning.
<br><br>
The projects here focus on topics such as graph traversal, adjacency structures, pathfinding, heightmaps, and other grid or graph based representations. My aim is to explore how these ideas behave in practice, and to present them in a clear, interactive way.
<br><br>
Everything here is built with simplicity and accessibility in mind, using browser-native technologies to make the underlying logic easy to follow.
